TODO: My Queue
The queue, for now, does not need to be dynamic, i.e., you do not need to be able to adjust the video positions, etc.
My Queue has:
  - lists of queues
    - each queue item
      - tracks a video(title)
      - video rating, if set by user
      - genre
      - position in the queue
TODO: code my_queues#show template, backed by @my_queue
=end
TODO: wrap the queue position field to accept only integers, not floats. Use 'transactions' to do this.

TODO: User is able to update the queue position of video items.
