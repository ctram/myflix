TODO: My Queue
The queue, for now, does not need to be dynamic, i.e., you do not need to be able to adjust the video positions, etc.
My Queue has:
  - lists of queues
    - each queue item
      - tracks a video(title)
      - video rating, if set by user
      - genre
      - position in the queue
